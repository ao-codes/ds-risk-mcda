# ds-risk-mcda

Description
-----------

ds-risk-mcda is a Python library that is intended to enable researchers to analyze risks of data
science projects by using procedures from so-called multi-criteria decision analysis. In the current
version, ds-risk-mcda can apply two popular mcda approaches, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
and a combined approach of AHP and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal
Solution (AHP-TOPSIS). It creates Excel-based assessment files, which can be filled out by experts
or risk analysts, and can then read the filled Excel files back in to carry out the corresponding
analyses. In addition, ds-risk-mcda has rudimentary options for simulating risk analyzes using the
methods mentioned.
